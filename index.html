                    " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encourage to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended "
